    "\n",
    "The method has been implemented as the function `power_method_cond()`, which takes a matrix $A$ and optional parameters `tol` (corresponding to the threshold value determining convergence) and `max_iter` (specifying the maximum number of iterations).  \n",
    "It returns the result for the power method, the built-in function, and the difference between the results.  \n",
    "When calculating eigenvalues, it uses the Rayleigh quotient.  \n",
    "The `solve` function from `scipy` (solving systems of equations) is used to implement the inverse power method to improve calculations. Thanks to these improvements, it was also possible to minimize problems with operations for non-diagonalized matrices.\n",

    "\n",
    "The condition number of a matrix $A$ (in the 2-norm) is defined as the ratio of the largest to the smallest singular value of the matrix:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\kappa(A) = \\frac{\\sigma_{\\max}(A)}{\\sigma_{\\min}(A)}\n",

    "    The power method allows approximating the largest eigenvalue of the matrix $A^T A$, which equals the square of the largest singular value $\\sigma_{\\max}^2$.  \n",
    "    We iteratively determine the vector $b_k$ and the eigenvalue $\\lambda_{\\max}$:\n",

    "2. **Smallest eigenvalue (inverse power method)**  \n",

    "#### Advantages and limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "- The power method is simple and effective for large, sparse matrices.\n",
    "- The accuracy of determining the smallest eigenvalue may be limited, especially for matrices with very large condition numbers or close to singularity.\n",
    "- In practice, for matrices with very small or very large elements, the method may be less accurate than built-in numerical algorithms.\n",

    "**Summary:**  \n",
    "The power method allows for approximate determination of the condition number of a matrix by iteratively estimating the largest and smallest eigenvalues of the matrix $A^T A$, which corresponds to the largest and smallest singular values of the matrix $A$."
